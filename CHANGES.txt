``zope.mkzeoinstance`` Changelog
================================


3.9.4 (2010-04-22)
------------------

- Renamed the script / package ``mkzeoinstance`` to avoid clashing with the
  script bundled with ZODB.

- Added an option to spell the host interface to be listened on, as well as
  the port the generated ZEO server configuration.  Thanks to Igor Stroh
  for the patch.  See: https://bugs.launchpad.net/zodb/+bug/143361

- Fixed generated templates to cope with the move of ``zdaemon`` code into
  its own project.

- Forked from the version of the ``mkzeoinst`` script contained in
  ZODB 3.9.4.
